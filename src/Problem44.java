	 Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
// pent a b
 pent c = b+b-a+3
 c = pent if c*6== c*3 -1 // cant have 2 pents next to each other sum to the next pent
 
 pent x = b+b-  ? 
 y = how many nums before/after b do you want? positive num for after, neg for before
 x = sqrt(b*6) +1 ) /3 ) - y )
 a = x^2 ) *3 ) -x ) /2
 
 22 +70 = 92
 70 is 3 more pents than 22 to add to a pent, but how do we know how many...how do we know 3?
 same goes for the one before...how do we know how many to minus?
 
 
 but we want b + x to be pent and b-x or x-b to be pent
 
It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk - Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?
